# SKILL: Market Attractiveness Scoring Engine

**Version:** 2.0
**Created:** 2026-03-06
**Framework:** Alex Hormozi ($100M Leads), Chet Holmes (7x4x11)
**Input Sources:** SC1 (Project Definition) + SC2 (ICP Clarity)
**Output File:** `MarketAttractiveness.md`
**Execution Model:** Claude-administered questionnaire with real-time AI scoring

---

## 1. STRATEGIC PURPOSE

Market Attractiveness Scoring (MAS) determines whether a market is worth entering by shifting from subjective ratings to evidence-based validation. Rather than asking founders to rate pain intensity 1-5, the system requires concrete evidence: customer conversations, competitive research, market data, regulatory signals, and growth indicators.

**Philosophy:** Student provides evidence; AI validates findings; output is a defensible market assessment.

**Philosophical Shift from Previous Version:**
- Old: "How intense is the pain? Rate 1-5."
- New: "Show me your evidence that pain is real. Cite conversations, data, competitor reviews, market research."

---

## 2. PREREQUISITES

This scorecard builds on upstream data. Do not administer until student has completed:

| Prerequisite | Provides | Used In |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| **SC1: Project Definition** | Niche, sub-market, positioning, geography, product scope | Sections C, D (MENA context) |
| **SC2: ICP Clarity** | Pain statements, congregation points, budget range, buying behavior | Sections A, B, C (all evidence) |

**Pre-Admin Checklist:**
- Display SC1 outputs (niche, positioning, geography, ICP)
- Display SC2 outputs (pain statements, congregation points, budget range)
- Ask student: "Are these still accurate? Any updates?"
- Note any updates; flag for cross-scorecard consistency review

## 4. SECTION A: PAIN REALITY & INTENSITY (25 POINTS)

**Goal:** Validate that SC2 pains are real, frequent, costly, and urgent through evidence, not speculation.

### A1. Pain Evidence Strength (5 pts)
**Type:** Free-text, 150-word limit
**Question:**
> From your ICP pain statements (listed from SC2), which THREE pains have the STRONGEST evidence of being real? For each pain, cite your evidence: customer conversations, competitor reviews, market data, case studies, or observable behavior.

**Display:** Show SC2 pain statements as reference. Provide example: "Pain: 'Invoice reconciliation wastes 15 hours/week.' Evidence: 4 finance managers confirmed; competitor reviews mention 'time-saving' (500+ FreshBooks reviews); ZATCA mandate forces e-invoicing."

**AI Scoring Rubric:**

| Score | Criteria | What AI Checks |
|-------|----------|---|
| 0 | Blank or off-topic | Did not attempt |
| 1 | Assertion only ("I think") | No evidence cited; pure speculation |
| 2 | Generic evidence | Vague sources ("asked people"); no names, numbers, or quotes |
| 3 | Partial evidence | 2 types for 1 pain OR 1 type for 2 pains; some specificity |
| 4 | Strong evidence | 2+ types per pain for ≥2 pains; named sources; numbers cited |
| 5 | Expert evidence | 3+ types per pain across all 3 pains; could use in pitch deck |

**Evaluation Process:**
1. Extract 3 pains mentioned; verify they match SC2 pain statements
2. For each pain, count distinct evidence types (conversations, data, competitive, research, regulatory)
3. Assess specificity: Named people/companies (high) vs. generic sources (low)
4. Check consistency with SC2 pain map
5. Award: (Diversity × 0.5) + (Specificity × 0.3) + (Consistency × 0.2)

**Improvement (if <4):**
- Score 0-2: "Schedule 3 buyer conversations THIS WEEK. Ask: 'How does this pain show up for you?' Document stories, not yes/no."
- Score 2-3: "For #1 pain, gather 3 sources: (1) conversation quote, (2) competitive evidence, (3) data point. Name and number everything."
- Score 3-4: "Add one more evidence type per pain. Check Google Trends, LinkedIn, competitor support forums."

**Time to Fix:** 2-5 hours (conversations + research)

---

### A2. Pain Frequency (5 pts)
**Type:** Multiple Choice × 3 (one per pain)
**Question:** How often does **[Pain from A1]** occur for your buyer?

**Options:**
- Multiple times daily (5 pts)
- Daily (4 pts)
- Weekly (3 pts)
- Monthly (2 pts)
- Quarterly or less (1 pt)

**Scoring:** Average of 3 pain frequencies. Deterministic (no interpretation).

**Consistency Check:** If pain cost (A3) is high but frequency is quarterly, flag (possible high-impact rare events). Ask for clarification; don't penalize if explained.

**Improvement (if score <3):**
> "Your frequency average is low. Either: (1) Find daily/weekly pains, OR (2) Show how infrequent pains compound. Example: 'Quarterly audit failure × 4/year × 30 hours = 120 hours/year = 2.5 weeks.'"

**Time to Fix:** 30 minutes (reframe or pivot pain)

---

### A3. Pain Cost (5 pts)
**Type:** Free-text, 100-word limit
**Question:** Quantify the cost of your #1 pain per month. Show your math.

**Display Example:** "Pain: Manual invoice reconciliation. Cost: 4 finance staff × 15 hours/week ÷ 4 = 15 hours/month × $50/hour = $750/month. Plus: 2 errors/month × $200 audit cost = $400/month. Total: $1,150/month."

**AI Scoring Rubric:**

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | No quantification ("very expensive") |
| 1 | Partial math (incomplete or unclear formula) |
| 2 | Rough estimate (math valid but arbitrary numbers) |
| 3 | Reasonable math (realistic unit costs; misses 1 cost type) |
| 4 | Sharp calculation (multiple cost types; all clear; realistic) |
| 5 | Expert (comprehensive model; sensitivity analysis; investor-grade) |

**Evaluation Process:**
1. Extract and verify math (hours × rate = cost)
2. Check unit realism ($30-150/hour for labor is realistic; $50-1K per error typical)
3. Assess completeness (labor + error + opportunity cost)
4. MENA adjustment: Egypt/Jordan labor may be $20-40/hour; validate consistency
5. Award: (Math × 0.4) + (Unit Realism × 0.35) + (Completeness × 0.25)

**Improvement (if <4):**
- Score 0-2: "Pick ONE cost driver and calculate it. If 10 hours/week × $50/hour = $2,000/month. That's your baseline."
- Score 2-3: "Add missing costs: errors/rework + opportunity cost. Include all cost types."
- Score 3-4: "Validate unit costs with a buyer: 'Is $50/hour loaded cost right for your team?'"

**Time to Fix:** 1-2 hours (research + math)

---

### A4. Workaround Assessment (5 pts)
**Type:** Free-text, 150-word limit
**Question:** What are buyers doing TODAY to manage this pain? List tools, processes, workarounds. How broken are they?

**Display Example:** "Workarounds: (1) Manual spreadsheet INDEX/MATCH (errors if format changes), (2) Temp staff hiring (expensive, turnover loss), (3) Quarterly audits (reactive, errors found too late). Failures: Formula breaks → hidden errors → audit discovers massive backlog → expensive rework."

**AI Scoring Rubric:**

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | No answer |
| 1 | "Not doing anything" (unaware of buyer behavior) |
| 2 | Generic ("spreadsheets and manual processes") |
| 3 | Named tools ("Excel, Zapier, manual emails") with basic failures |
| 4 | Tools + specific failures ("formula breaks if format changes"; "hiring delays") |
| 5 | Comprehensive failure map with failure chains and buyer frustration clear |

**Evaluation Process:**
1. Extract named tools/processes
2. Count distinct failure points (errors, delays, cost, hiring friction, knowledge loss)
3. Assess specificity: "INDEX/MATCH breaks" (specific) vs. "it's slow" (generic)
4. Check consistency: Do workarounds match pain statement?
5. Award: (Tool Specificity × 0.4) + (Failure Count × 0.3) + (Articulation × 0.3)

**Improvement (if <4):**
- Score 0-2: "Interview 3 ICPs. Ask: 'Walk me through how you handle this today. What breaks?' Take notes."
- Score 2-3: "You know tools; now know failures. Ask: 'What bugs you about this? When has it failed?'"
- Score 3-4: "Deepen failure analysis. Ask: 'Why do you keep using this despite problems?' Answer = your moat."

**Time to Fix:** 2-3 hours (interviews)

---

### A5. Pain Urgency Signal (5 pts)
**Type:** Free-text, 100-word limit
**Question:** If you pitched tomorrow, what timeline would buyer want? (week/month/quarter/someday) What evidence supports it?

**Display Example:** "Urgency: This month. Evidence: (1) ZATCA mandate effective next month; (2) CFO said 'We need solution before month-end'; (3) Budget allocated in Q; (4) Competitor launched. Multiple external pressures = HIGH urgency."

**AI Scoring Rubric:**

| Score | Criteria | Signal Type |
|-------|----------|---|
| 0 | Blank | N/A |
| 1 | Wishful thinking ("want it ASAP"; no evidence) | Hope, not reality |
| 2 | Logical assumption (reasonable guess; unvalidated) | Internal logic only |
| 3 | Some signals (1-2 present; budget allocated, timeline mentioned) | Beginning of urgency |
| 4 | Strong signals (2-3: regulatory + budget + competitive) | Multiple pressure points |
| 5 | Validated urgency (3+ signals; direct buyer statement; external deadlines) | Investment-grade |

**Signal Hierarchy:** Regulatory deadline > Competitive pressure > Budget deadline > Operational crisis > Seasonal > Buyer statement > Aspiration

**Evaluation Process:**
1. Extract claimed timeline (week/month/quarter/someday)
2. Count distinct signals; categorize by hierarchy
3. Assess evidence quality: Direct quote (high) > Assumption (low)
4. Check consistency: Does timeline match evidence?
5. Award: (Timeline Realism × 0.3) + (Signal Count × 0.4) + (Evidence Quality × 0.3)

**Improvement (if <4):**
- Score 0-2: "Ask ICP: 'When would you need this? What makes that timeline urgent?' Find external pressure: regulation, competitor, budget deadline, crisis."
- Score 2-3: "Find one external signal. Verify its date. Is regulatory deadline in writing? Is budget allocation confirmed?"
- Score 3-4: "Ask: 'What happens if you DON'T solve this by [timeline]?' Their answer = cost of inaction."

**Time to Fix:** 1-2 hours (buyer conversation)

**Section A Total:** A1+A2+A3+A4+A5 = 0-25 pts

---

## 5. SECTION B: PURCHASING POWER & WILLINGNESS (25 POINTS)

**Goal:** Validate that ICP has budget and will pay.

### B1. Existing Spend (5 pts)
**Type:** Free-text, 100-word limit
**Question:** What are buyers CURRENTLY PAYING for related problems? List tools/services and monthly spend.

**Display Example:** "Current spend: (1) QuickBooks: $25/month; (2) Zapier: $99/month; (3) Freelance accountant: $300/month; (4) Internal labor: 40 hours × $50/hour = $2,000/month. Total: $2,424/month."

**AI Scoring Rubric:**

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Blank or "I don't know" |
| 1 | Generic ("accounting software"; no names, prices) |
| 2 | Some specificity (1-2 tools; vague pricing) |
| 3 | Specific tools (3+ named; prices; may miss labor) |
| 4 | Sharp spend map (named tools + prices; includes labor cost) |
| 5 | Expert (complete spend; hidden costs; purchasing precedent clear) |

**Evaluation Process:**
1. Extract named tools; count pricing data points
2. Assess completeness (tools + services + labor + vendors)
3. Verify realism (QuickBooks $25-300/month is realistic; $5K/month is not)
4. Check consistency with pain cost (A3): Should be in same ballpark
5. Award: (Tool Specificity × 0.35) + (Price Completeness × 0.35) + (Labor Inclusion × 0.3)

**Improvement (if <4):**
- Score 0-2: "Interview 3 ICPs: 'What tools do you use for [problem]? What's the monthly cost?' Get vendor names and actual prices."
- Score 2-3: "Add pricing. Google vendor prices. Ask: 'Do you pay for freelance help?' Include labor cost."
- Score 3-4: "Good map. Validate: Ask 'How much do you spend per month on [problem]?' Your estimate should align."

**Time to Fix:** 1-2 hours (interviews + web research)

---

### B2. Budget Authority (5 pts)
**Type:** Multiple Choice (2 pts) + Free-text (3 pts)

**MC:** Who controls the budget for your solution?

- User + 1 approver (2 pts)
- Department head (1.5 pts)
- C-suite (1 pt)
- Committee (1 pt)

**Free-text (75 words):** Describe the budget decision process. Who proposes? Who approves? Timeline? Thresholds?

**Display Example:** "Finance Manager proposes to Finance Director. Director approves if <$500/month + ROI >3x within 1 week. If >$500/month, needs CFO (4 weeks). Our price: $150/month → Director approval → 1-week sales cycle."

**Free-text Scoring (0-3):**
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Blank |
| 1 | Generic ("they need approval") |
| 2 | Partial (decision-maker named; missing timeline/thresholds) |
| 3 | Sharp (decision-maker + timeline + thresholds + connection to sales cycle) |

**Combined:** MC (0-2) + Free-text (0-3) = 0-5 pts

**Evaluation Process:**
1. Extract MC (simplicity score): simpler = higher score
2. Extract free-text details (decision-maker, timeline, thresholds)
3. Check consistency: Does ACV from SC1 fit within decision threshold?
4. Flag if ACV exceeds threshold (longer sales cycle)
5. Award: (MC × 0.4) + (Free-text Quality × 0.6)

**Improvement (if <3):**
> "Interview decision-maker: 'If you wanted to buy [solution] at $[price]/month, how would approval work? Who would you ask? How long?' Document exact process and timeline."

**Time to Fix:** 1-2 hours (buyer interview)

---

### B3. Price Point Validation (5 pts)
**Type:** Free-text, 100-word limit
**Question:** What price are you charging? Compare to: (a) pain cost, (b) alternative spend, (c) ROI delivered. Does it pass the no-brainer test?

**Display Example:** "Price: $199/month. (a) Pain cost $1,150/month; price is 17% of pain. (b) Alternatives $2,424/month; price is 8% of alternatives. (c) ROI: Customer pays $2,388/year; saves $13,800/year; ROI = 5.8x. Verdict: Clear no-brainer; customer saves $2,225/month net."

**AI Scoring Rubric:**

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | No price |
| 1 | Price only (no comparison) |
| 2 | Partial logic (ONE benchmark; missing others) |
| 3 | Two comparisons (clear but incomplete) |
| 4 | Three comparisons (clear "no brainer" calc) |
| 5 | Expert model (all 3 comparisons + sensitivity analysis) |

**Evaluation Process:**
1. Extract price; normalize to $/month
2. Validate vs. pain cost (A3): Price < 50% pain cost = good; < 25% = strong
3. Validate vs. alternatives (B1): Price < 25% = good
4. Calculate ROI: Annual cost vs. annual savings; aim for 3x+ minimum
5. Check math accuracy
6. Award: (Pain Comparison × 0.27) + (Alternative Comparison × 0.27) + (ROI × 0.26) + (Clarity × 0.2)

**Improvement (if <4):**
- Score 0-2: "Use formula: Pain cost × 30-40% = entry price. Example: $1,150 × 35% = $400/month."
- Score 2-3: "All 3 benchmarks required. Calculate ROI: (Annual savings) ÷ (Annual cost) = ROI multiple. Aim for 3x+"
- Score 3-4: "Stress-test with buyer: 'Would you pay $[price] to save $[pain]?' Their reaction tells you if realistic."

**Time to Fix:** 1-2 hours (modeling + validation)

---

### B4. Payment Infrastructure (5 pts)
**Type:** Multiple Choice (MENA-specific context)

- Mixed/multiple (5 pts)
- Cash/check (2 pts)
- Unknown (0 pts)

**MENA Adjustments:** If "Credit card only" in Egypt/Jordan/Lebanon/Morocco: Deduct 1 pt (credit card adoption <40%; should add bank transfer or BNPL).

**Display:** Show MENA context. "Saudi: Credit card adoption 65%; mobile wallet 90%. Egypt: Credit card 30%; WhatsApp Pay adoption emerging. Offer 2-3 methods to maximize conversion."

**Improvement (if <5):**
- If credit card only (Egypt/Jordan): "Add bank transfer (primary) + BNPL secondary. Increases conversion significantly."
- If Unknown: "Ask ICP: 'How do you prefer to pay for SaaS? Credit card, bank transfer, BNPL?' Their answer guides your infrastructure."

**Time to Fix:** 30 minutes (research + setup)

---

### B5. Willingness Signal (5 pts)
**Type:** Free-text, 100-word limit
**Question:** What is the STRONGEST signal that someone would PAY? (pre-orders, verbal commits, LOIs, pilots, competitor revenue, market research)

**Display Example:** "Signal: Signed LOI with [Company] for $2K/month pilot. CTO: 'This is exactly what we need; we can start [month].' Also: 8 people on waitlist said 'I'd pay $200-300/month.' LOI is strongest signal."

**AI Scoring Rubric:**

| Score | Signal Type | Criteria |
|-------|---|---|
| 0 | No signal | Blank |
| 1 | Aspirational | "I think people would pay" (no evidence) |
| 2 | Behavioral | Waitlist, email signups, free trial (intent; no commitment) |

| 4 | Signed | Signed LOI, paid pilot, pre-order agreement |
| 5 | Executed | Paid pilot in progress, pre-orders collected, competitor revenue data |

**Hierarchy:** Executed Payment > Signed Commitment > Verbal > Behavioral > Aspirational

**Evaluation Process:**
1. Identify signal type; map to hierarchy
2. Assess specificity: Named buyer (high) vs. generic (low)
3. Verify commitment level: Money down > Signature > Verbal > Behavioral > Aspirational
4. Check consistency with urgency (A5)
5. Award: (Signal Type × 0.4) + (Specificity × 0.3) + (Commitment Level × 0.3)

**Improvement (if <4):**
- Score 0-2: "Go get a willingness signal. Contact 5 ICPs; ask 'Would you pay $[price] for this?' Get 2-3 explicit yes answers. Document names."
- Score 2-3: "Convert waitlist → pilot. Offer 50% off if they commit to $500 pilot in 30 days."
- Score 3-4: "Turn verbal → signed. Send one-page LOI: '[Company] agrees to pilot [solution] for $[price] from [date] to [date].' Get signature."

**Time to Fix:** 1-3 weeks (outreach + pilot closure)

**AI Scoring Rubric:**

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Blank |
| 1 | Vague ("LinkedIn"; no specific group/location) |
| 2 | Generic ("LinkedIn finance group"; no estimate) |
| 3 | Specific point + rough estimate |
| 4 | Sharp calculation (layered: total → filtered by role → filtered by size → actual fit) |
| 5 | Expert map (multiple points ranked; specific counts; actionable reach) |

**Evaluation Process:**
1. Extract congregation point; verify it matches SC2 points
2. Extract density estimate; check calculation quality
3. Assess layering: Total → Role filter → Size filter → Geography filter = actual ICP fit
4. Award: (Specificity × 0.3) + (Estimation Quality × 0.35) + (Filtering Logic × 0.35)

**Improvement (if <4):**
- Score 0-2: "Name ONE congregation point (LinkedIn group, conference, business club, city). Research its size."
- Score 2-3: "Validate estimate with actual data (LinkedIn group member count, conference attendee list, census data)."
- Score 3-4: "Layer the estimate. Of 5K group members: 20% right role × 40% right size × 50% right industry = 200 prospects."

**Time to Fix:** 2-3 hours (research + filtering)

---

**Type:** Free-text, 100-word limit
**Question:** Can you reach 100+ buyers in 30 days with your resources? Describe exactly how.

**Display Example:** "Plan: (1) LinkedIn outbound: 20 messages/week × 4 weeks = 80 reach attempts; 20% response = 16 meetings. 30 min/day. (2) Cold email: 10/week × 4 = 40 attempts; 5% response = 2 meetings. Total: 120 reach attempts, ~18 meetings, 1 hour/day. Achievable."

**AI Scoring Rubric:**

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Blank |
| 1 | No path ("I'll use LinkedIn") |
| 2 | Some path (channels named; numbers missing/unrealistic) |
| 3 | Specific path (channels + weekly targets; realistic) |
| 4 | Sharp plan (channels + daily cadence + response rates + time/resources) |
| 5 | Expert model (multiple channels + targets + validated rates + contingency) |

**Evaluation Process:**
1. Extract channels and targets
2. Check realism: LinkedIn 15-20 quality msgs/week/person is realistic; 100+/week is not
3. Verify math: Sum targets; do they reach ~100 in 30 days?
4. Confirm resources: Can stated team do this?
5. Award: (Channel Diversity × 0.2) + (Target Specificity × 0.35) + (Realism × 0.35) + (Resource Clarity × 0.1)

**Improvement (if <3):**
- Score 0-1: "Pick ONE channel. Calculate: 100 people ÷ 30 days = 3.3/day. For LinkedIn: 4 msgs/day × 20-30 min = achievable."
- Score 1-2: "Make specific. 'LinkedIn: 4 msgs/day × 5 days × 4 weeks = 80 msgs. 20% response = 16 replies. 30 min/day = 10 hours total.'"
- Score 2-3: "Stress-test: Can you ACTUALLY do 20 msgs/day while running business? If not, reduce target or phase it."

**Time to Fix:** 2-3 hours (planning + validation)

---

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Blank |
| 1 | Vague ("I'll use LinkedIn") |
| 2 | Specific ("5K connections, 15% response rate, 30 min/day") |

**Combined:** MC (0-5) + Free-text (0-4) → normalize to 0-5

**Evaluation Process:**
1. Verify channel selections align with ICP
2. Extract capability specifics (audience, response rate, time)
3. Check for proof (actual experience vs. aspirational)
4. Assess consistency: Does free-text match MC selections?
5. Award: (Channel Fit × 0.35) + (Capability Detail × 0.35) + (Proof × 0.3)

**Improvement (if <4):**

- Proof missing: "Have you tried this channel? Do 20 attempts this week; measure response rate."

**Time to Fix:** 1-2 weeks (validate channels + measure)

---

### C4. Competitor Access Pattern (5 pts)
**Type:** Free-text, 100-word limit
**Question:** How are competitors reaching these buyers? What channels dominate? Where are they weak?

**Display Example:** "Competitors [A, B] dominate LinkedIn (15K followers; weekly posts) and content (SEO-ranked). Absent from: WhatsApp outreach, email list, community engagement. Gap: MENA congregates on WhatsApp; competitors ignore it. Opportunity: Own WhatsApp channel + email list in [geography]."

**AI Scoring Rubric:**

**AI Scoring Rubric:**

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Blank |
| 1 | Western assumptions ("email and LinkedIn standard"; no MENA adaptation) |
| 2 | Surface awareness ("MENA uses WhatsApp more"; vague) |
| 3 | Some context (2-3 MENA factors mentioned; partial channel mix) |
| 4 | Sharp strategy (3-4 factors; channel % provided; language clear) |
| 5 | Expert (detailed mix by geography; language strategy; local competitive advantage identified) |

**Evaluation Process:**
1. Extract geography (from SC1)
2. Identify MENA factors mentioned (language, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, email, events, mobile)
3. Compare student's channel mix to baseline table (unrealistic mix = flag)
4. Assess language strategy (Arabic/English/mixed)
5. Assess local competitive positioning
6. Award: (Factors Mentioned × 0.3) + (Channel Mix Realism × 0.35) + (Language × 0.2) + (Competitive Position × 0.15)

**Improvement (if <3):**
- Score 0-1: "Research [country]'s communication norms. Google '[country] business communication preferences.' Ask 2 local founders: 'How do you reach customers here? What channels work?'"
- Score 2: "You know WhatsApp is important; expand. What about LinkedIn adoption? Email culture? Events? For [country], provide realistic percentages."
- Score 3: "Good MENA awareness. Add language strategy. Will you do Arabic outreach? How will this affect response rates?"

**Time to Fix:** 2-3 hours (research + local conversations)

| 2 | Generic ("I read [market] is growing"; no source/numbers) |
| 3 | Sharp ("Gartner 2026 report: 18% CAGR through 2030"; specific numbers) |

**Combined:** MC (0-2) + Free-text (0-3) = 0-5 pts

**Evaluation Process:**
1. Map MC to growth category
2. Extract free-text sources: Analyst firms (Gartner, McKinsey, Statista) + competitor funding + customer growth
3. Assess evidence quality: Named firm + report year + numbers (highest) vs. generic opinion (lowest)
4. Verify consistency: Does free-text match MC? (If MC says "rapidly growing," evidence should show 30%+ growth)

| 1 | No tailwinds ("don't know any") OR only generic ("technology advancing") |
| 2 | Generic tailwinds (1 trend; no specificity/dates) |
| 3 | Some specific (2 tailwinds named; missing dates/impact) |
| 4 | Sharp (2-3 specific + dated tailwinds; clear buyer urgency connection) |
| 5 | Expert (3+ specific tailwinds; dates; magnitude; strategic interpretation) |

**Evaluation Process:**
1. Extract tailwind types (regulatory, economic, technology, cultural, competitive)
2. Assess specificity: "ZATCA e-invoicing effective June 2026" (specific) vs. "digitization happening" (vague)
3. Verify realism: Are dates correct?
4. Assess relevance: Does tailwind push toward student's solution? (Direct = strong; tangential = weak)
5. Assess magnitude: How many buyers affected? (Regulatory affecting ALL companies in jurisdiction = highest)
6. Award: (Tailwind Count × 0.35) + (Specificity × 0.35) + (Solution Relevance × 0.3)

**Improvement (if <2):**
- Score 0-1: "Brainstorm tailwinds. What regulatory changes, cost pressures, or technology shifts affect your market in [geography]? Find 2-3 specific examples."
- Score 2: "Be specific. Instead of 'digitization happening,' name regulation (ZATCA, Vision 2030, data law). Instead of 'costs rising,' state: 'Labor inflation 8% YoY.'"

**Time to Fix:** 2-3 hours (research)

|-------|---------|----------|------------|-----|
| **Already Buying** | Category exists; competitors operate; buyers compare | UAE/Saudi SaaS, fintech | Fast (4-8 wks) | Price competitive |
| **Aware Not Buying** | Know category; barriers: price, culture, regulatory | Egypt B2B SaaS (aware; expensive) | Medium (8-16 wks) | Education + ROI |
| **Unaware** | Don't know category exists | MENA early B2B SaaS; AI tools | Long (16-26 wks) | Authority building |
| **Resistant** | Legacy systems entrenched; cultural/regulatory blockers | MENA government compliance | Very Long (26+ wks) | Focus new entrants |

**Free-text Scoring (0-3):**
| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | Blank |
| 1 | Assumption ("I think market is ready"; no evidence) |
| 2 | Some evidence (ONE source: competitors OR buyers OR research) |
| 3 | Sharp (Multiple sources: competitors + buyer conversations + adoption data) |

**Combined:** MC (0-2) + Free-text (0-3) = 0-5 pts

**Evaluation Process:**
1. Map MC to readiness level
2. Extract evidence types (competitor presence, buyer conversations, market research, regulatory)
3. Check evidence quality: Multiple sources (high) vs. single source (low)
4. Assess realism: Is readiness appropriate for their geography?
5. Award: (MC × 0.4) + (Free-text Quality × 0.6)

**Improvement (if <3):**
- Score 0-1: "Research market readiness. (1) Do competitors exist in [geography]? (2) Talk to 3 ICPs: 'Do you know solutions in this category?' (3) Check regulatory status. Return with evidence-based readiness."
- Score 2: "Find one more evidence source. If you have competitor presence, add buyer conversations. If you have buyer data, add market research."
- MC ≠ Free-text: "Your evidence doesn't support your claim. If you said 'Already Buying' but evidence is 'saw one competitor,' that's actually 'Aware Not Buying.' Update MC to match evidence."

**Time to Fix:** 2-3 hours (competitor + buyer research)
